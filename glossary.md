### WebTest

[WebTest from Canoo](http://webtest.canoo.com/webtest/manual/WebTestHome.html) is a testing toolkit built on top of the [browser simulator](clients.md#browser-simulators) [HtmlUnit](#htmlunit).

You write your tests in an extensible DSL, either in Ant XML or Groovy, run them, and get nice reports.

Beware: It's a pretty specialized tool (Java, HtmlUnit, rather old, seemingly unmaintained), so you should think three times before considering it.
